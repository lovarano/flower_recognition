# Pytorch flower image classifier

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This project was part of my Udacity Nanodegree for Artificial Intelligence. Once the classifier is trained it is able to classify flowers from 102 categories.</p>
<p>The programm is using Pytorch and can be run in a command line interface. Please note the flower folder contains three subfolder for train, test and validate the classifier. However, those folder do not contain all images due to the size of the folders.</p>
<p>You can download additional data for example on https://www.kaggle.com/</p>
<h2>Supporting Material</h2>
<p>To create this classifier I used official tutorials from Pytorch website. Here is the direct link:</p>
